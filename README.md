**What we're about**

Learn, Collaborate & Develop the coolest applications with the coolest technology!

Meet other developers in your community that are using and learning about [Okteto](https://github.com/okteto/okteto). Okteto lets you build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in Kubernetes:

Develop and deploy your applications in [Okteto Cloud](https://okteto.com/) for free. Code locally with the tools you know and love. Run and debug directly in Okteto Cloud.

Share your application with the world by adding them to the Okteto Cloud [Application Catalog](https://okteto.com/docs/tutorials/repos/index.html), and put your ideas in production with the click of a button.

Learn more about Okteto and join us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oktetohq), or in the #okteto channel in the [Kubernetes community Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/).

## Workshop based on Okteto Cloud 

Okteto Cloud gives you free access to sandboxed Kubernetes namespaces, fully integrated with remote development capabilities. Develop your Kubernetes applications in Okteto Cloud and forget about slow and tedious local development forever.
